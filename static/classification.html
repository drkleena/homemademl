            <h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>

        </div>














        <div class="container" id = paragraph>

            <p>What is classification all about?
            Well, what we mean when we talk about
            classification is the process of applying
            categories to items in our data.
            By its very nature this task is very
            common amongst us humans. All day our brains fire
            constantly to decide which clothes to put on,
            what food to have during the day, among many
            other different discrete decisions.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="container" id = classification_image>


        </div>

        <div class="container" id = heading>



        </div>

        <div class="container" id = paragraph>

            <p>This task entails taking data
                and applying a Machine Learning
                model to it and then with this model,
                draw predictions about the data. The
                final result leads to us taking a instance
                of data and deciding what category it belongs to.
                Typically, classification comes in two flavors:
                Binary (exactly 2) or Multi-class (2 or more).
                This distinction is a large factor in what model
                to use in a classification problem.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="container" id = paragraph>

            <p>To get a better example of why classification
                exists in this context here is an example,
                suppose you are a bank and a customer walks
                through the door and asks for a loan.
                To assess whether this individual will be
                able to meet the payments for the loan, you
                as the loan representative must analyze their
                past fiscal behavior and through some
                decision-making process either provide the
                customer with the loan or not.
                Here our instance is a customer and the
                classification task is either to give the
                loan or not. The task of Classification in
                Machine Learning would aim to automate this decision-making
                process by gathering loads of past data about various
                individuals and their ability to pay back loans within
                the life of the loan and deduce patterns and relationships
                between financial behavior and loan defaulting.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id = paragraph>

            <p>But what are models? Models are mathematical abstractions
            about the data we deal with. Most models have their roots in
            classical statistics and rely on quantitative analysis of the
            data to gauge relationships in it. Models encapsulate the
            decision-making process that ties a row of data to a label t
            hat describes it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" id = paragraph>

            <p>Once we have our data and our model,
            we ‘train’ the model on the data and then
            being to throw new instances at it and see
            how it performs – evaluation. This last step is
            crucial for any machine learning method,
            since we would be wasting our time if our algorithm
            was no better than random guessing.
            This first chapter will involve learning
            how to build your first classification model from scratch,
            and then how to apply an evaluation method to see how well it does.
